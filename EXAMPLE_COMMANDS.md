## 🎬 Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include character names (Arjun, Nexus) and clear actions
2. **Build Tension**: Use commands that create conflict or mystery
3. **Vary Commands**: Mix dialogue requests with action descriptions
4. **Progressive Story**: Build on previous commands to create a narrative
5. **Test Features**: Try different types (dialogue, action, emotional moments)
6. **Use Context**: Reference previous dialogue to maintain continuity
7. **Listen**: Each character has a unique voice - notice the difference!

## 📝 Command Formatting Tips

### Good Commands:
- ✅ "Arjun discovers encrypted files on the server."
- ✅ "Nexus reveals the truth about the hackathon."
- ✅ "Arjun and Nexus debate whether to expose the conspiracy."

### Less Effective:
- ❌ "Make them talk." (too vague)
- ❌ "Generate dialogue." (not specific)
- ❌ "Continue the scene." (lacks direction)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If commands don't generate expected dialogue:
1. **Check Backend**: Make sure Python backend is running on port 8000
2. **Check API Key**: Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set in .env file
3. **Check Console**: Look at browser console (F12) for errors
4. **Be Specific**: More specific commands generate better results
5. **Build Context**: Use multiple commands to build story context

If voices sound the same:
1. **Check Browser**: Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. **Check Auto-Play**: Make sure auto-play is enabled to hear sequential playback
3. **Volume**: Check your system volume and browser audio settings

## 🎉 Example Workflow
